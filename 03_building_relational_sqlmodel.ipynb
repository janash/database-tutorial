    "In the previous notebook, we learned about SQL queries and how to build a SQLite database by building queries and executing them using Python.\n",
    "When we took this approach, we had to write the SQL ourselves, which can be time-consuming and error-prone, and also varies depending on the database system we are using.\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll learn about a Python library called SQLModel that can be used to build databases by writing Python classes. The classes are then used to create the database schema and interact with the database without writing SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLModel is something called an  ORM, or an \"object-relational mapping\" library. \n",
    "An ORM is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. \n",
    "This allows us to interact with a database using Python objects, which can make our code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"classic\" ORM in Python is [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/), which is a very powerful and flexible library.\n",
    "Many of MolSSI's own projects such as QCArchive or SEAMM use SQLAlchemy for their databases.\n",
    "SQLModel is a more \"modern\" ORM that is built on top of SQLAlchemy, and is designed to be easier to use and more Pythonic.\n",
    "SQLModel combines SQLAlchemy with data validation through [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) and is easier to plug into apps like APIs using FastAPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook starts with a convenience function for removing the database we will create in it (this is in case you run the notebook more than once!)"

    "## Defining a Table using SQLModel\n",
    "\n",
    "When using an ORM, you define tables using Python classes and inheritance.\n",
    "Briefly, inheritance is a way to define a new class that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class.\n",
    "The classes will start with  the behavior of some base class, and is extended through additional code definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of SQLModel, we can create a SQL table by inheriting from the class `SQLModel` and setting the `table` argument to `True`.\n",
    "Defining the columns of the table is very similar to defining a model using Pydantic.\n",
    "SQLModel uses SQLAlchemy, a standard ORM in Python coupled with Pydantic for validation, making it a bit quicker to prototype than SQLAlchemy.\n",
    "Each column is given a name by adding a class attribute to your class. \n",
    "The name of the column will correspond to the name of the attribue in the class.\n",
    "The name of the SQL table will correspond to the name of the class, but in all lower case.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using SQLModel, The attributes (columns) must be accompanied by type-hinting.\n",
    "This will allow SQLModel to map the Python type of the variable to the SQL type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if there are any constraints on the column such as a primary key or uniqueness, \n",
    "that is added by using the `SQLModel` `Field` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, we have defined columns for the `Article` table.\n",
    "The class is set up to define a SQL table that has fields named `doi` (type `str`), `title` (type `str`), `publication_year` (type `int`), `abstract` (`optional`, type `str`, default `None`)."
