    "## Database structure\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous presentation, we mentioned that relational databases are structured and have a specific schema. \n",
    "For this tutorial, we will create a database with a normalized schema.\n",
    "The application we will be considering is a database that will hold information about scientific papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create our relational database, our first step will be to decide the structure. \n",
    "The goal of relational databases with a normalized schema is to reduce repetition of information and dependencies between rows, this is called **normalization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tables\n",
    "The **table** is the basic unit of storage in a relational database. \n",
    "A table is made up of columns which define the data being stored in the table, and rows (also called records) which are entries in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, consider what information about some of our papers would look like if we just added it to a spreadsheet.\n",

    "## Identifying unique entries - Primary Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a relational database, having unique identifiers for records in each table is crucial. \n",
    "These unique identifiers are called primary keys. A primary key ensures that each record in a table can be uniquely identified.\n",
    " Let’s look at how primary keys are used in our current table structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have an `Article` table that uses the DOI as its primary key. This ensures that each article can be uniquely identified because no two articles will have the same DOI. Similarly, the `Author` table uses `Author ID` as its primary key, which uniquely identifies each author in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary keys can be single columns, or they may be composed of multiple columns, known as composite keys. \n",
    "For example, in our `Article-Author` table, neither the DOI nor the Author ID alone can uniquely identify a record, as the same article can have multiple authors, and the same author can contribute to multiple articles. \n",
    "In this case, the combination of both the DOI and the Author ID forms a composite primary key. \n",
    "This composite key ensures that each author-article relationship is unique, preventing duplication of the same author-article pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see more on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foreign Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns in the `Article-Author` table are also examples of **foreign keys**.  \n",
    "Foreign keys reference values in other tables.  \n",
    "For example, the `Article DOI` column in the `Article-Author` table references the `DOI` column in the `Article` table.  \n",
    "Foreign keys are constraints that ensure data integrity by enforcing that every reference in the `Article-Author` table corresponds to an actual entry in the `Article` table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `Author ID` column in the `Article-Author` table is a foreign key that references the `Author ID` column in the `Author` table.  \n",
    "These relationships help maintain the consistency and integrity of the data across the database.  \n",
    "Don't worry if this is all a lot to remember right now!  \n",
    "We will work on applying these ideas later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Second Normal Form (2NF) and Third Normal Form (3NF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we didn't explicitly discuss it, our database structure is in the second normal form (2NF) and third normal form (3NF).\n",
    "The second normal form (2NF) requires that the table is in the first normal form and that all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.\n",
    "In our database this means that we don't repeat the article DOI with the author names, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third normal form (3NF) requires that the table is in the second normal form and that all non-key\n",
    "attributes are non-transitively dependent on the primary key. In our database structure, we might violate 3NF if we wanted to store journal publisher information in the `Article` table.\n",
    "This information is not directly related to the article, but to the journal, and should be stored in a separate table in order to maintain 3NF.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relationships\n",
    "Central to the idea of relational databases are...relationships! You can already see from inspection how these tables are related. \n",
    "You would be able to figure out authors for a paper by tracing relationships through our three tables. Relational databases have specific relationship patterns, so let's discuss these.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Many to Many relationships\n",
    "The article-author table we've created is what is known as an associative table. \n",
    "Consider the type of relationship between papers and authors. \n",
    "One paper can have many authors, and one authors can have many papers (consider that T. Daniel Crawford is an author on two of our papers). \n",
    "This is called a *many to many* relationship. \n",
    "When we have these in a database, we will have an associative table. \n",
    "In addition to the two tables outlined, we will also have an author table (where each author is listed by ID) which the `article-author` table will index into. \n",
    "\n",
    "### One to Many and Many to One relationships\n",
    "Another type of relationship is the *one to many* relationship. \n",
