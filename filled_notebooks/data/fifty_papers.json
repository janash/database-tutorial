                "abstract": "In-silico methods are increasingly becoming reliable tools to replicate and extend from experimental findings of chemical biodegradability. Information derived from quantitative activity-structure relationships (QSARs) have the potential to have rules extracted that can aid the understanding of biodegradation. Using semi-empirical quantum chemical calculations, the use of a conformer-based augmentation approach, along with dimensionality reduction methods, was studied in the context of achieving improved model accuracy and applicability. This work highlights molecular features, from graph-based features, 3-dimensional structural descriptors, to direct graph-based learning methods, that can be used to distinguish readily biodegradable compounds, and the role of unsupervised pre-processing in refining the training set and choice of features.",

                "abstract": "Molecular electronics, which is governed by quantum mechanics, urgently requires establishing predictive frameworks and rules to combine molecular components and create miniaturized integrated circuits. To this end, we have recently demonstrated a bis-terpyridine based molecular breadboard with four conductance state formed by the superposition of five 2-5ring circuits. Here, we develop a generic analytical/statistical model to extract the conductance of the five embedded circuits in a bis-terpyridine based molecular breadboard junction. The model can be used to experimentally verify the rules for superposing the conductance of multiple molecular circuits, a key step towards building molecular circuitry. Further, our study provides a general framework to simulate and analyze break-junction conductance histograms of complex molecular junctions with more than two electrode anchoring groups.",

                "abstract": "The OpenQP (Open Quantum Platform) is a new open-source quantum chemistry library developed to tackle sustainability and interoperability challenges in the field of computational chemistry. OpenQP provides various popular quantum chemical theories as autonomous modules such as energy and gradient calculations of HF, DFT, TDDFT, SF-TDDFT, and MRSF-TDDFT, thereby allowing easy interconnection with third-party software. A scientifically notable feature is the innovative Mixed-Reference Spin-Flip Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (MRSF-TDDFT) and its customized exchange-correlation functionals such as DTCAM series of VAEE, XI, XIV, AEE, and VEE, which significantly expands the applicability scope of DFT and TDDFT. OpenQP also supports parallel execution and is optimized with BLAS and LAPACK for high performance. Future enhancements such as EKT-MRSF-TDDFT and SOC-MRSF-TDDFT will further expand OpenQP\u2019s capabilities. Additionally, a Python wrapper PyOQP is provided that performs tasks such as geometry optimization, conical intersection searches, and nonadiabatic coupling calculations, among others, by prototyping the modules of OpenQP library in combination with third-party libraries. Overall, OpenQP aligns with modern trends in high-performance scientific software development by offering flexible prototyping and operation while retaining the performance benefits of compiled languages like Fortran and C. They enhance the sustainability and interoperability of quantum chemical software, making OpenQP a crucial platform for accelerating the development of advanced quantum theories like MRSF-TDDFT.",

                "title": "Investigating the Interaction between Excipients and Monoclonal Antibodies PGT121 and N49P9.6-FR-LS: A Comprehensive Analysis",
                "abstract": "N49P9.6-FR-LS and PGT121 are promising antibodies with significant therapeutic potential against HIV infection, but they are prone to precipitation at high concentrations. This study evaluates the influence of six excipients\u2014L-arginine, L-alanine, sucrose, trehalose, methionine, and glutamate\u2014on the biophysical stability of antibodies. We employed a comprehensive approach, combining computational mAb-excipient interaction analysis via the site-identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) method with extensive experimental characterization. Our experimental matrix included viscosity measurements across temperature gradients, particle size distribution, zeta potential, pH value, and solution appearance, alongside a short-term stability study at 30\u00b0C and 65% relative humidity, with assessments at t0 (initial), t1 (14 days), and t2 (28 days). Results indicated that sucrose, arginine, alanine, and trehalose provided varying degrees of stabilization for both antibodies. Conversely, glutamate destabilized PGT121 but stabilized N49P9.6-FR-LS, while methionine had a negative effect on N49P9.6-FR-LS but a positive one on PGT121. SILCS-Biologics analysis suggested that stabilization by these excipients is linked to their ability to occupy regions involved in self-protein interactions. Debye\u2013Hu\u0308ckel\u2013Henry charge calculations further indicated that neutral excipients like sucrose and trehalose could alter mAb charges by affecting buffer binding, influencing aggregation propensity. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing antibody formulations, ensuring enhanced stability and therapeutic efficacy for HIV treatment.",

                "abstract": "Accurate prediction of the affinity of ligand binding to nucleic acids represents a significant challenge for current computational approaches. This limitation has hindered the use of computational methods to develop small molecule drugs that modulate the activity of nucleic acids, including those associated with anticancer, antiviral and antibacterial effects. In recent years, significant scientific and technological advances as well as easier access to compute resources have contributed to free-energy perturbation (FEP) becoming one of the most consistently reliable approaches for predicting relative binding affinities of ligands to proteins. Nevertheless, FEP\u2019s applicability to nucleic-acid targeting ligands has remained largely undetermined. In this work, we present a systematic assessment of the accuracy of FEP, as implemented in the FEP+ software and facilitated by improvements in the OPLS4 force field, in predicting relative binding free energies of congeneric series of ligands interacting with a variety of DNA/RNA systems. The study encompassed more than 100 ligands exhibiting diverse binding modes, some partially exposed and others deeply buried.  Using a consistent simulation protocol, more than half of the predictions are within 1 kcal/mol of the experimentally measured values. Across the dataset, we report a combined average pairwise root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 1.39 kcal/mol, which falls within one log unit of the experimentally measured dissociation constants. These results suggest that FEP+  has sufficient accuracy to guide the optimization of lead series in drug discovery programs targeting RNA and DNA.",

                "abstract": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit promise as porous materials for carbon capture due to their design versatility and large pore sizes. The generic force field (e.g. UFF and Dreiding) uses one set of Lennard-Jones parameters for each element, while MOFs have a much richer local chemical environment than those used to fit the UFF. When MOFs contain hard-Lewis acid metals, UFF systematically overestimates $CO2$ uptakes within MOFs. To address this, we developed a workflow to affordably and efficiently generate reliable force fields to predict \\ce{CO2} adoption isotherms of MOFs containing metals from groups IIA  (e.g. Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) and IIIA (e.g., Al, Ga, In), connected to various carboxylate ligands. This method uses experimental isotherms as input. The optimal parameters are obtained by minimizing the loss function of the experimental and simulated isotherms, in which we use the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) theory can be used to derive the functionality relationship of loss functions in terms of force field parameters.",

                "abstract": "Molecular flexibility is a commonly used, but not easily quantified term. It is at the core of understanding composition and size of a conformational ensemble and contributes to many molecular properties. For many computational workflows, it is necessary to reduce a conformational ensemble to meaningful representatives, however defining them and guaranteeing the ensemble\u2019s completeness is difficult. We introduce the concepts of torsion angular bin strings (TABS) as a discrete vector representation of a conformer\u2019s dihedral angles and the number of possible TABS (nTABS) as an estimation for the ensemble size of a molecule, respectively. Here, we show that nTABS corresponds to an upper limit for the size of the conformational space of small molecules and compare the classification of conformer ensembles by TABS with classifications by RMSD. Overcoming known drawbacks like the molecular size dependency and threshold picking of the RMSD measure, TABS is shown to meaningfully discretize the conformational space and hence allows e.g. for fast checks of the coverage of the conformational space. The current proof-of-concept implementation is based on the ETKDGv3sr conformer generator as implemented in the RDKit and known torsion preferences extracted from small-molecule crystallographic data.",

                "abstract": "We present the largest dataset of highly-accurate vertical and degenerate two-photon transition strengths ($\\delta^{\\mbox{\\tiny TPA}}$) for standard small- and medium-sized organic molecules, calculated using the quadratic response implementation of the third-order coupled cluster method that includes iterative triples (Q-CC3). The aug-cc-pVTZ basis set was used for all small molecules, while medium-sized molecules were assessed with aug-cc-pVDZ and the differences due to the basis sets are discussed. This dataset, encompassing 82 singlet transitions of various characters (Rydberg, valence, and double excitations), enables a comprehensive benchmark of both small basis sets and, alternative wavefunction methods when Q-CC3 calculations become beyond reach. These methods include quadratic (Q) response and equation of motion CCSD approximations, Q-CC2, second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction in its intermediate state representation (I-ADC2), as well as time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) with a set of 5 commonly used exchange-correlation functionals. This extensive analysis provides a quantitative assessment of these methods, revealing how different system sizes, response intensities, and types of transitions affect their performances.",

                "abstract": "The electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising realisation of negative emissions to mitigate climate change, aiming at the efficient production and safe longterm storage of carbon-rich sink products. This approach, however, necessitates novel catalyst materials specifically targeting electrochemical carbon dioxide removal. In this work, we investigate synthesis routes for a cerium-incorporated GaInSn-based liquid metal catalyst, focusing on the electrochemical production of graphitic carbon. Preparation and preconditioning of the catalyst are found to be crucial for carbon production, while trace amounts of H2O and OH in the organic electrolyte play a decisive role for the efficiency of the electrocatalytic process. Finally, for a better understanding of the reaction mechanism and the involved active species, experimental findings and density functional theory-based calculations are combined, suggesting a two-step reduction pathway with Ce(OH)x as the catalytically active surface species.",

                "title": "Smoother Semiclassical Dispersion for Density Functional Theory via D3S: Understanding and Addressing Unphysical Minima in the D3 Dispersion Correction Model ",
                "abstract": "One of the most widely used and computationally efficient models that accounts for London dispersion interactions within density functional theory (DFT) is the D3 dispersion correction model. In this work, we demonstrate that this model can induce the appearance of unphysical minima on the potential energy surface (PES) when the coordination number of atoms changes. Optimizing to these artifactual structures can lead to significant errors in determining the interaction energy between two molecules and in estimating the thermodynamic properties of the system. In several specific examples, such as Kuratowski-type H2-NiKur and H2-PdKur clusters, these local minima exhibited extremely high PES curvature, resulting in incorrect estimations of harmonic frequencies and significant overestimations of zero-point energy and enthalpy values. Although such erroneous behavior of the D3 model is relatively rare, it can occur across a wide range of chemical species, including molecules like the [Li(C6H6)]+ complex and the dispiro(acridan)-substituted pyracene (DSAP) molecule. Our analysis reveals that the root of the problem lies in the definition of the AB atomic-pair dependent C6AB coefficients in the D3 model. To address this issue, we propose a re-parameterization of the D3 model by introducing a modified C6AB functional form that now depends on the specific pair of considered atoms. This new model, termed D3-Smooth (or D3S for short), is designed to smooth out the PES associated with the dispersion correction. By doing so, we demonstrate that D3S eliminates unphysical local minima while maintaining the quite satisfactory accuracy of the parent D3 method in interaction energy benchmark sets. For example, the RMS difference between using the D3(BJ) correction to B3LYP and the D3S(BJ) correction across the large MGCDB84 dataset of nearly 5000 data points is only 0.12 kJ/mol. Similar results are obtained for every other D3-corrected functional tested.

                "abstract": "Discovery of new types of reactions is essential to organic chemistry because it expands the scope of molecular scaffolds that can be made and can help trace new and more economical syntheses of existing structures1-4. Within the spectrum of all possible reaction classes, those that build complex scaffolds from multiple simple components in one step (i.e., multicomponent reactions, MCRs5-11; Figure 1a) and/or proceed sequentially in one pot12-14 are appealing as they may capitalize on the use of unstable intermediates, minimize separation and purification operations, and increase the overall step- and atom-economy15 as well as \u201cgreenness\u201d16,17 of synthesis. However, the number of known MCR classes remains limited to several hundred (Figure 1b and interactive map at https://mcrmap.allchemy.net), and the number of publications reporting new ones appears to decrease in recent years (Figure 1c), perhaps because the most popular reactivity patterns (e.g., isocyanide, \u03b2-dicarbonyl, or imine-based MCRs) and their straightforward extensions and combinations18 have been studied in nearly exhaustive detail. The discovery process continues to rely, per Ivar Ugi\u2019s famous quote, on thoughtful \u201creflection [\u2026] or combinatorial techniques,\u201d5 and even when supported by high-end quantum mechanical methods, requires prior knowledge of \u201cfitting\u201d substrates (e.g., recent ref. 19 vs. closely analogous MCRs from earlier ref. 20,21). The \u201creflection\u201d regards not only the choice of substrates but, above all, careful consideration of possible cross-reactivities between numerous intermediates, reagents, and side-/by-products present in a multicomponent mixture \u2013 in effect, translating into a laborious analysis of complex networks of mechanistic steps. Here, we show that computers equipped with accurate and broad knowledge of mechanistic transforms can perform such network analyses rapidly and in a high-throughput manner, and can guide systematic discovery, ranking, and yield estimation of unprecedented types of MCRs, one-pot sequences and even organocatalytic reactions, several of which we validate by experiment. These results evidence that synthesis-planning algorithms are no longer limited to skillful manipulation of the existing knowledge-base of \u201cfull reactions\u201d22-28 but can assist in its creative expansion.

                "abstract": "Quantum computing promises exponential advances in information processing, necessitating the development of appropriate materials for implementing quantum qubits and gates. Liquid crystals, known for their electro-optical characteristics and use in displays, have recently received attention as prospective candidates for quantum computing applications.\nThis review delves into the role of liquid crystals in quantum information science, starting with an overview of their characteristics, classification and phase transition mechanisms. It then directs focus to their quantum attributes, their ability to display quantum coherence and entanglement. The review also showcases validations of quantum phenomena in liquid crystals, highlighting their suitability for use in quantum systems.\nRecent advances are discussed, including the development of liquid crystal qubits, quantum gates, and circuits. The review also explores the integration of liquid crystals with quantum photonic devices, emphasizing their role in enhancing quantum communication and information processing. Potential room temperature operation applications such as quantum sensing and quantum cryptocurrency are illustrated through case studies.\nChallenges such as material synthesis, decoherence, stability, and compatibility with existing technologies are addressed, with proposed solutions including hybrid systems and novel fabrication techniques. Future research directions focus on innovative liquid crystal materials, interdisciplinary collaboration, and their use in emerging quantum technologies.\n",

                "abstract": "Current approaches to the discovery of mechanochemical reactions in polymers are limited by the interconnection of the zero-force and force-modified potential energy surfaces, since most mechanochemical reactions are force-biased thermal reactions. Here, carbamoyloximes are developed as a mechanophore class in which the mechanochemical reaction rates counterintuitively increase together with the thermal stability. All carbamoyloxime mechanophores undergo force-induced homolytic bond scission at the N\u2013O bond and their mechanochemical scission rate increases with the degree of substitution on the \u03b1-substituent. Yet, carbamoylaldoximes react to both heat and light with a pericyclic syn elimination while carbamoylketoximes undergo thermal decomposition at high temperature and photochemical homolytic scission only from the triplet state. Thereby, the mechanochemical and thermal reaction trajectories are separated and the thermal stability increases alongside the mechanochemical reaction kinetics. This approach may play an important role in the future of systematic mechanochemical reaction discovery.",

                "abstract": "Cheminformatics and Machine Learning (ML) have seen exponential progress in the last decade, in the field of chemical risk assessment, due to their efficiency, accuracy, and reliability. The constant evolution of New Approach Methodologies (NAM) has inspired researchers around the globe to deviate from conventional approaches and adopt or develop new, \u201cunconventional\u201d methods. The classification Read-Across Structure-Activity Relationship (c-RASAR) is an unconventional approach that utilizes similarity and error-based information from the nearest neighboring compounds into a Machine Learning modeling framework, resulting in enhanced predictivity. Although this technique has so far been applied to molecular descriptors, we have applied this approach in the present study on molecular fingerprints along with conventional molecular descriptors for ML-based model development from a recently reported highly curated set of orally active nephrotoxic drugs. We initially developed ML models using nine different linear and non-linear algorithms separately on molecular descriptors and MACCS fingerprints, thus generating 18 different ML QSAR models. Using the chemical spaces defined by the modeling descriptors and fingerprints, the similarity and error-based RASAR descriptors were computed, and the most discriminating RASAR descriptors were used to develop another set of 18 different ML c-RASAR models. All 36 models were cross-validated 20 times with a 5-fold cross-validation strategy, and their predictivity was checked on the test set data. A multi-criteria decision-making strategy \u2013 the Sum of Ranking Differences (SRD) approach - was adopted to identify the best-performing model based on robustness and external validation parameters. This statistical analysis suggested that the c-RASAR models had an overall good performance, while the best-performing model was also a c-RASAR model. This model was used to screen a true external set data prepared from the known nephrotoxic compounds of DrugBankDB. These results also showed that our model efficiently identifies nephrotoxic compounds. The t-SNE analyses on the descriptors, fingerprints, and the RASAR descriptor spaces inferred that the RASAR descriptors efficiently encode the chemical information, as evident from the tight and distinct clustering of the data points. Additionally, the molecular descriptors and the corresponding RASAR descriptors were used to identify potential activity cliffs using the ARKA framework.",

                "abstract": "Efficient formations of excited triplet states on the metal-free photosensitizer dyads, bodipy-phenoxazine (BDP-PXZ) and tetramethylbodipy-phenoxazine (TMBDP-PXZ), were investigated by ab initio calculations. We revealed the reason why two different triplet transient species, 3CT and 3BDP, can co-exist only for BDP-PXZ as observed in the previous study with the TR-EPR measurements. It was found that the state mixing of 3CT enables the transition from 1CT to 3CT and 3BDP states only for BDP-PXZ . This mixing effect is commonly seen in the singlet states of twisted intermolecular charge transfer molecules, though the key factor that determines the mixing of the excited states of the dyes was found to be the electron-donating ability of the substituents rather than their steric hindrance. The mechanism was corroborated by comparing the spin polarization ratio of the triplet spin-sublevels measured by the TR-EPR with the theoretical predictions. The spin polarization ratio of the triplets should contain information about the transition via intersystem crossing, e.g. the twisted angle of two chromophores of the dyad, and thus it can be a powerful tool to analyze the molecular mechanism of photochemical processes at the electronic structure level. These insights on molecular structures\u2019 effect provided by this theoretical study would be a compass to molecular design for metal-free triplet photosensitizers.",

With this workflow, we were able to discover three new classes of palladium complexes capable of achieving the synthesis of non-alternating polyketones with a lower CO content than known catalysts. Our re-sults show that we more than doubled the number of known classes of compounds that can catalyze the formation of this type of polymer. We envision that this methodology can be applied to accelerate catalyst discovery when selectivity is an important outcome. ",

                "abstract": "The Lewis acidic nature of aluminum atoms in common precursors for the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 can lead to dimerization. This study investigates whether these compounds predominantly exist as monomers or dimers under ALD conditions. Understanding dimerization is crucial for discussing precursor reactivities and other properties, especially in the context of area-selective ALD (AS-ALD). We employed a theoretical approach, incorporating conformer search, density functional theory, and coupled cluster calculations, to determine the dissociated dimer fraction for a range of precursors under typical ALD pressures and temperatures. The precursors studied include aluminum alkyls, chlorinated aluminum alkyls, dimethylaluminumisopropoxide (DMAI), and trisdimethylamidoaluminum (TDMAA). Our findings indicate that aluminum alkyls are completely dissociated over the whole parameter range, while DMAI and TDMAA form stable dimers. Chlorinated precursors were found to exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms depending on temperature and pressure.",

                "abstract": "The calculation of density-based basis-set correction (DBBSC), which remedies the basis-set incompleteness (BSI) error of the correlation energy, is combined with local approximations. Aiming at large-scale applications, the procedure is implemented in our efficient local natural orbital-based coupled-cluster singles and doubles with per- turbative triples [LNO-CCSD(T)] scheme. To this end, the range-separation function, which characterizes the one-electron BSI in space, is decomposed into the sum of con- tributions from individual localized molecular orbitals (LMOs). A compact domain is constructed around each LMO, and the corresponding contributions are evaluated only within these restricted domains. Furthermore, for the calculation of the com- plementary auxiliary basis set (CABS) correction, which significantly improves the Hartree\u2013Fock (HF) energy, the local density fitting approximation is utilized. The er- rors arising from the local approximations are examined in detail, efficient prescreening techniques are introduced to compress the numerical quadrature used for DBBSC, and conservative default thresholds are selected for the truncation parameters. The effi- ciency of the DBBSC-LNO-CCSD(T) method is demonstrated through representative examples of up to 1000 atoms. Based on the numerical results, we conclude that the corrections drastically reduce the BSI error using double-\u03b6 basis sets, often to below 1 kcal/mol compared to the reliable LNO-CCSD(T) complete basis set references, while significant improvements are also achieved with triple-\u03b6 basis sets. Considering that the calculation of the DBBSC and CABS corrections only moderately increases the wall-clock time required for the post-HF steps in practical applications, the proposed DBBSC-LNO-CCSD(T) method offers a highly efficient and robust tool for large-scale calculations.",

To address this, we present the Catalytic Large Atomic Model (CLAM), a machine-learning-based interatomic potential designed for heterogeneous catalysis. Trained on a comprehensive dataset that includes metals, alloys, oxides, clusters, zeolites, 2D materials, and small molecules, CLAM ensures high accuracy across diverse catalytic systems. We also introduce a \"local fine-tuning\" algorithm that enhances the model\u2019s applicability by accelerating structural optimizations and transition state searches while maintaining precision. Additionally, CLAM facilitates rapid reaction network construction and efficient kinetic analysis. This work advances computational catalysis by providing a universal and robust tool for catalyst design and mechanism exploration.",

                "abstract": "Quantum-chemical fragmentation methods offer an attractive approach for the accurate calculation of  protein--ligand interaction energies. While the Molecular Fractionation with Conjugate Caps (MFCC) scheme offers a rather straightforward approach for this purpose, its accuracy is often not sufficient. Here, we upgrade the MFCC scheme for the calculation of protein--ligand interactions by including  many-body contributions. The resulting fragmentation scheme is an extension of our previously developed MFCC-MBE(2) scheme [\\textit{J. Comput. Chem.} \\textbf{44}, 1634\u20131644 (2023)].    For a diverse test set of protein--ligand complexes, we demonstrate that by upgrading the MFCC scheme with many-body contributions, the error in protein--ligand interaction energies can be reduced significantly, and generally yields errors below 20 kJ/mol. Our scheme allows for systematically reducing these errors by including higher-order many-body contributions. As it combines the use  of single amino acid fragments with high accuracy, our scheme provides an ideal starting point  for the parametrization of accurate machine learning potentials for proteins and protein--ligand interactions.",

                "abstract": "Micelles formed by bile salts in aqueous solution are important for solubilization of hydrophobic molecules in the gastro intestinal tract. The molecular level information about the mechanism and driving forces for primary-to-secondary micelles transition is still missing. In the current study the micelle formation of 50 mM solutions of taurodeoxycholate (TDC) is studied by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. It is shown that primary micelles with an aggregation number of 8-10 emerge and persist within the first 50 ns, which then coalesce to form secondary micelles with an aggregation number of 19 molecules. This transition is governed by hydrophobic interactions, which significantly decrease the solvent-accessible surface area per molecule in the secondary micelles.\nThe addition of monomers of the sodium salt of fatty acids (FA) to secondary TDC micelles results in the co-existence of mixed FA-TDC and pure FA micelles. The studied saturated FAs, with chain lengths of C14:0 and C18:0, are incorporated into the micelle core, whereas TDC molecules position themselves around the FAs, forming a shell on the micelle surface. In contrast, the tails of the C18:1 unsaturated fatty acid mix homogeneously with TDC molecules throughout the entire micelle volume. The latter creates a very suitable medium for hosting hydrophobic molecules in the micelles containing unsaturated fatty acids.",

PepFuNN is a Python package comprising five modules to study peptides with natural amino acids and, in some cases, sequences with non-natural amino acids based on the availability of a public monomer dictionary. The modules allow calculating physicochemical properties, performing similarity analysis using different peptide representations, clustering peptides using molecular fingerprints or calculated descriptors, designing peptide libraries based on specific requirements, and a module dedicated to extracting matched pairs from experimental campaigns to guide the selection of the most relevant mutations in design new rounds. The code and tutorials are available at: https://github.com/novonordisk-research/pepfunn",

                "abstract": "The vast size of composition space poses a significant challenge for materials chemistry: exhaustive enumeration of potentially interesting compositions is typically infeasible, hindering assessment of important criteria ranging from novelty and stability to cost and performance. We report a tool, Comgen, for the efficient exploration of composition space, which makes use of logical methods from computer science used for proving theorems. We demonstrate how these techniques, which have not previously been applied to materials discovery, can enable reasoning about scientific domain knowledge provided by human experts. Comgen accepts a variety of user-specified criteria, converts these into an abstract form, and utilises a powerful automated reasoning algorithm to identify compositions that satisfy these user requirements, or prove that the requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied. In contrast to machine learning techniques, explicitly reasoning about domain knowledge, rather than making inferences from data, ensures that Comgen\u2019s outputs are fully interpretable and provably correct. Users interact with Comgen through a high-level Python interface. We illustrate use of the tool with several case studies focused on the search for new ionic conductors. Further, we demonstrate the integration of Comgen into an end-to-end automated workflow to propose and evaluate candidate compositions quantitatively, prior to experimental investigation. This highlights the potential of automated formal reasoning in materials chemistry.",

                "title": "Evaluation of Natural Flavonoid Compounds in Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) Inhibition for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Treatment ",
                "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, resulting in significant cognitive impairment. Currently, two drugs have been approved for Alzheimer\u2019s treatment, however, it does not specifically target the amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Given that, herbal remedies from plants have also been recommended to enhance cognitive function and alleviate AD symptoms. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate potential natural flavonoid compounds to target the inhibition of amyloid \u03b2 as a novel treatment for AD, using an in silico structure-based approach. 3D structure of the amyloid \u03b2 protein target and the flavonoid compounds are acquired from Protein Data Bank (PDB) and PubChem database, respectively. The flavonoids are first screened for drug-likeness by ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) screening and toxicity prediction using SWISS-ADME and ProTox-II web server. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis is also done to check for amyloid beta aggregation inhibitors and beta-amyloid protein antagonist activity in the compounds. Molecular docking and visualization are done to analyze the binding affinity of the ligands to the protein target using CB-Dock2. Finally, we perform molecular dynamics using CABSFLEX2 web-server to predict the protein fluctuations based on the root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) of the best flavonoid compound. Based on the drug-likeness, toxicity, and QSAR analysis, epicatechin shows the best potential flavonoid compound as amyloid \u03b2 inhibitor. Two poses were found for 1 2 epicatechin which had identical binding energies but different pocket sizes. Our findings indicate the potential for natural flavonoid compounds as an alternative treatment in AD targeting amyloid \u03b2 plaques activity.",

                "abstract": "Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) seeks to identify all thermodynamically accessible solid forms of a given compound and, crucially, to establish the relative thermodynamic stability between different polymorphs. The conventional hierarchical CSP workflow suggests that no single energy model can fulfill the needs of all stages in the workflow, and energy models across a spectrum of fidelities and computational costs are required. Hybrid ab initio/empirical force-field (HAIEFF) models have demonstrated a good balance of these two factors, but the force-field component presents a major bottleneck for model accuracy. Existing parameter estimation tools for fitting this empirical component are inefficient and have severe limitations on the manageable problem size. This, combined with a lack of reliable reference data for parameter fitting, has resulted in developments in the force-field component of HAIEFF models having mostly stagnated. In this work, we address these barriers to progress. Firstly, we introduce a curated database of 755 organic crystal structures, obtained using high quality, solid-state DFT-D calculations, which provide a complete set of geometry and energy data. Comparisons to various theoretical and experimental data sources indicate that this database provides suitable diversity for parameter fitting. In tandem, we also put forward a new parameter estimation algorithm implemented as the CrystalEstimator program. Our tests demonstrate that CrystalEstimator is capable of efficiently handling large-scale parameter estimation problems, simultaneously fitting as many as 62 model parameters based on data from 445 structures. This problem size far exceeds any previously reported works related to CSP force-field parameterization. These developments form a strong foundation for all future work involving parameter estimation of transferable or tailor-made force-fields for HAIEFF models. This ultimately opens the way for significant improvements in the accuracy achieved by the HAIEFF models.",

                "abstract": "The field of computational chemistry is increasingly leveraging machine learning (ML) potentials to predict molecular properties with high accuracy and efficiency, providing a viable alternative to traditional quantum mechanical (QM) methods, which are often computationally intensive. Central to the success of ML models is the quality and comprehensiveness of the data sets on which they are trained. Quantum chemistry data sets and databases, comprising extensive information on molecular structures, energies, forces, and other properties derived from QM calculations, are crucial for developing robust and generalizable ML potentials. In this review, we provide an overview of the current landscape of quantum chemical data sets and databases. We examine key characteristics and functionalities of prominent resources, including the types of information they store, the level of electronic structure theory employed, the diversity of chemical space covered, and the methodologies used for data creation. Additionally, an updatable resource is provided to track new data sets and databases at https://github.com/Arif-PhyChem/datasets_and_databases_4_MLPs. Looking forward, we discuss the challenges associated with the rapid growth of quantum chemical data sets and databases, emphasizing the need for updatable and accessible resources to ensure the long-term utility of them. We also address the importance of data format standardization and the ongoing efforts to align with the FAIR principles to enhance data interoperability and reusability. Drawing inspiration from established materials databases, we advocate for the development of user-friendly and sustainable platforms for these data sets and databases.",

                "abstract": "Imparted with uniquely high and broad-scope bioactivity including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, antimicrobial and anticancer properties, the IntegroPectin phytocomplex obtained from citrus processing waste via hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) was investigated via Density Functional Theory. The main flavonoids of grapefruit (naringenin), orange (hesperidin), and lemon (eriocitrin) were taken into account along with a model structure for pectin including the RG-I rhamnogalacturonan chains. Results indicate that the pectin-flavonoid conjugate formation is slightly endergonic for all three conjugates, confirming the key role of HC in opening an energy window that allows to overcome the slightly positive \u0394Gform thanks to the energy released by the imploding cavitation bubbles. Cavitation eventually enables formation of these valued phytocomplexes  whose practical application is approaching.",

                "abstract": "Understanding historical chemical usage is crucial for assessing current and past impacts on human health and the environment and informing future regulatory decisions. However, past monitoring data is often limited in scope and number of chemicals, while suitable sample types are not always available for remeasurement. Data-driven cheminformatics methods on patent and literature data offer several opportunities to fill this gap. The chemical stripes were developed as an interactive, open source tool for visualising patent and literature trends over time, inspired by the global warming and biodiversity stripes. This paper details the underlying code and datasets behind the visualisation, with a major focus on the patent data sourced from PubChem, including patent origins, uses, and countries. Overall trends and specific examples are investigated in greater detail to explore both the promise and caveats that such data offers in assessing the trends and patterns of chemical patents over time and across different geographic regions. Despite a number of potential artefacts associated with patent data extraction, the integration of cheminformatics, statistical analysis, and data visualisation tools can help generate valuable insights that can both illuminate the chemical past and potentially serve towards an early warning system for the future.",

This identifier is associated with a metadata record describing key aspects of the article. It has become more common recently to include article citations in this record and most recently to also include reference to published datasets, themselves also assigned a DOI. Until very recently,  the Crossref schema describing the properties of the metadata record did not allow the type of the citation to be declared, but a proposal has now been made to augment the schema to allow citations to be identified as relating to datasets. The implications of these evolving changes to scholarly journal articles are here discussed both in the context of the increasing importance of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) and of the increasing need for declaring not only how data can be made available for AI/ML but also to be discovered in the first place.",

                "abstract": "Affinity selection-mass spectrometry (AS-MS) is a ligand discovery platform that relies upon mass spectrometry to identify molecules bound to a biomolecular target. When utilized with large peptide libraries (108 members), AS-MS sample complexity can surpass the sequencing capacity of modern mass spectrometers, resulting in incomplete data, identification of few target-specific ligands, and/or incomplete sequencing. To address this challenge, we introduce pyBinder to apply label-free quantitation (LFQ) to AS-MS data to process primary MS1 data and develop two scores to rank the peptides from the integration of their peak area: target selectivity and concentration-dependent enrichment. We benchmark pyBinder utilizing AS-MS data developed against a protein, anti-hemagglutinin antibody 12ca5, revealing that peptides that contain a motif known for target-specific high-affinity binding are well characterized by these two scores. AS-MS data from a second protein target, WD Repeat Domain 5 (WDR5), is analyzed to confirm the two pyBinder scores reliably capture the target-specific motif-containing peptides. From the results delivered by pyBinder, a list of target-selective ions is developed and fed back into subsequent MS experiments to facilitate expanded data generation and the targeted discovery of selective ligands. pyBinder analysis resulted in a four-fold increase in motif-containing sequence identification for WDR5 (from 3 ligands discovered to 14 discovered), showing the utility of the two scores.

                "abstract": "Free energy calculations are revolutionizing early-stage drug-discovery campaigns. Robust free energy methods can rapidly provide accurate on-target and off-target potency predictions to identify promising chemical matter for synthesis, thus, inspiring further rounds of ideation and optimization. Here, we present a free energy framework for efficiently achieving kinome-wide selectivity that led to the discovery of novel selective Wee1 kinase inhibitors. With ligand-based relative binding free energy calculations, multiple novel promising scaffolds were rapidly identified. With protein residue mutation free energy calculations that perturbed the Wee1 gatekeeper residue, off-target liabilities across the kinome of these promising series were efficiently reduced. With judicious identification of a selectivity handle, applying this computational strategy could effectively streamline the optimization of on-target and off-target profiles, thereby accelerating drug discovery timelines and decreasing unanticipated off-target toxicities.",

                "abstract": "The inherent randomness of polymers has long posed challenges for their representation learning in polymer machine learning (ML). The Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) notation, which has excelled in small molecule research, unfortunately, struggles to flexibly capture the complexity of polymer structures, such as random block copolymers. Recently, BigSMILES and its extensions have paved the way for more accurate descriptions of polymer structures. However, whether BigSMILES outperforms SMILES in polymer ML workflows has yet to be systematically explored and demonstrated. To fill this scientific gap, we conducted extensive experiments investigating this question, encompassing a variety of polymer property prediction and inverse design tasks based on both image and text inputs. Our findings reveal that in 11 tasks involving homopolymer systems, BigSMILES-based ML workflows exhibit performance comparable to or even exceeding that of SMILES, underscoring the utility of BigSMILES in representing polymer structures. Furthermore, BigSMILES offers a more compact textual representation compared to SMILES, significantly reducing the computational cost of model training, particularly for large language models. Through these comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that BigSMILES can achieve performance on par with SMILES, while also facilitating faster model training and reducing energy consumption, which could have a substantial impact on a wide range of polymer tasks in the future, including property prediction (and classification) and polymer generation across various polymer types.",

                "abstract": "We study the gap energy of the semiconducting oxide SnO2 through ab-initio calculations including both DFT and coupled cluster methods. The effectiveness of twist-averaging in reducing finite-size errors is evaluated across different functionals. We report an overestimation of gap energy when applying finite-size scaling at the thermodynamic limit in equation-of-motion (EOM) CCSD calculations. To mitigate one-body and many-body errors, we integrate twist averaging with a post-processing correction mechanism, comparing finite-size and infinite-size DFT calculations using hybrid functionals. While inspired by the Kwee, Zhang, and Krakauer (KZK) approach, our method is tailored to hybrid functionals for a more accurate treatment of exchange-correlation effects. Our approach ensures that the many-body interactions are accurately reflected in the estimated gap for an infinite system. We introduce unique single twist angles that yield cost- effective and accurate energies, in comparison to full twist averaging in the EOM-CCSD calculations. Applying this approach to SnO2, we calculate a fundamental gap of 3.46 eV, closely matching the 3.59 eV gap obtained from two-photon spectroscopy experiments, thereby demonstrating the accuracy of this method.",

                "abstract": "Identifying druggable binding sites on proteins is an important and challenging problem, particularly for cryptic, allosteric binding sites that may not be obvious from X-ray, cryo-EM, or predicted structures. The Site-Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS) method accounts for the flexibility of the target protein using all-atom molecular simulations that include various small molecule solutes in aqueous solution. During the simulations the combination of protein flexibility and comprehensive sampling of the water and solute spatial distributions can identify buried binding pockets absent in experimentally-determined structures. Previously, we reported a method for leveraging the information in the SILCS sampling to identify binding sites (termed Hotspots) of small mono- or bi-cyclic compounds, a subset of which coincide with known binding sites of drug-like molecules. Here we build in that physics-based approach and present a ML model for ranking the Hotspots according to the likelihood they can accommodate drug-like molecules (e.g. molecular weight > 200 daltons). In the independent validation set, which includes various enzymes and receptors, our model recalls 67% and 89% of experimentally-validated ligand binding sites in the top 10 and 20 ranked Hotspots, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the model\u2019s output Decision Function is a useful metric to predict binding sites and their potential druggability in new targets. Given the utility the SILCS method for ligand discovery and optimization the tools presented represent an important advancement in the identification of orthosteric and allosteric binding sites and the discovery of drug-like molecules targeting those sites.",

                "abstract": "Metazachlor (MTZ) herbicide oxidation initiated by sulfate radical anion (SO4\u25cf-) in water and gas was investigated using the density functional theory (DFT) at the M06-2X/6-311++G(3df,3pd)//M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory. Mechanisms and kinetics of MTZ oxidation via three oxidation mechanisms were investigated, including abstraction (Abs), addition (Add), and single electron transfer (SET). Results show that most oxidation reactions are favorable and spontaneous in both phases. The overall rate constants at 298.15K in water is 5.06 \u00d7 1010 M-1 s-1 whereas the one in gas is many times higher, 1.51 \u00d7 1013 M-1 s-1. Notably, the degradation in water is non-selected with the fastest reaction being SET with 5.76 \u00d7 109 M-1 s-1 and 11.39% of the kapp and \u0413, respectively. On the contrary, the one in gas almost occurs via Abs reaction with the fastest one being Abs-H24 with kapp and \u0413 values being 1.08 \u00d7 1013 M-1 s-1 and 71.76%. In addition, the influence of temperature on the degradation kinetics is evaluated. Results show that the degradation in water increases as a function of temperature (283 to 323 K), while the drawback trend is found in the gas phase from 253 to 323 K. Diving into the chemical nature of the hydrogen abstraction processes, it is noteworthy that the most predominant Abs reactions at the methyl and methylene groups occur via the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism. Overall, the SO4\u25cf--based degradation is an effective and potential method for removing MTZ herbicide. ",

                "abstract": "The most abundant nuclides in the cosmos have equal numbers of protons and neutrons. These include He-4, C-12, N-14, O-16, Ne-20, Mg-24, Si-28, and S-32, which together comprise 99.5% of ordinary polynucleonic matter. These are the most kinetically resilient (stable) nuclides within the highly exothermic reaction conditions of cosmic nucleosynthesis. This paper analyzes the relationship between a nuclide\u2019s equinucleonic (Z=N) composition and its relative cosmic abundance. Structural symmetry emerges as a sensitive and specific predictor of superabundance within a proposed alternating nucleon model. The model derives from the proton\u2019s radius (r =0.8414 fm), the hadron\u2019s prolate shape (from the transition to the proton\u2019s first excited state, the \u2206+(1232) resonance), and the separation distance between a pair of bound nucleons (\u2248 0.8 fm, from the nucleon-nucleon potential). Various nucleon geometries were considered for each nuclide, with preference given to structures having optimal numbers of stable proton-neutron short-range interactions and whose model radii (derived from the regular polygon radius formula) best correlate with experimental charge radii (r(31)=.98, p<.001). Remarkably, the best-fit solutions for the eight superabundant Z=N nuclides categorically demonstrate bilateral structural symmetry, in which neutrons reflect protons on opposite sides of a bisecting chiral plane. Conversely, when an element\u2019s stable isotopes are compared, the best-fit structures in which nucleon symmetry is not possible (generally because proton and neutron numbers are unequal) are less abundant by \u2248 2 orders of magnitude. Symmetry is ubiquitous in nature, and the proposed alternating nucleon model is consistent with the axiom that structural symmetry confers structural stability.",

This study presents a rational model that integrates density functional theory (DFT) calculation with a data-driven machine learning (ML) approach to predict the experimentally measured E_gap^exp of CPs, using 1096 data points. Through alkyl side chain truncation and conjugated backbone extension, the modified oligomers effectively capture the electronic properties of CPs, significantly improving the correlation between the DFT-calculated HOMO-LUMO gap (E_gap^oligomer) and E_gap^exp (R2=0.51) compared to the unmodified side-chain-containing monomers (R2=0.15). Moreover, we trained six ML models with two categories of features as input: E_gap^oligomer to represent the extended backbone and molecular features of unmodified monomers to capture the alkyl-side-chain effect. The best model, XGBoost-2, achieved an R2 of 0.77 and an MAE of 0.065 eV for predicting E_gap^exp, falling within the experimental error margin of \u223c0.1 eV. We further validated XGBoost-2 on a dataset of 227 newly synthesized CPs collected from literature without further retraining. Notably, XGBoost-2 exhibits both excellent interpolation for BT-, BTA-, QA-, DPP-, and TPD-based CPs, and exceptional extrapolation for PDI-, NDI-, DTBT-, BBX-, and Y6-based CPs, which are attributed to the integration of DFT methods with rationally designed oligomer structures. For the first time, we demonstrated a novel and effective strategy combining quantum chemistry calculations with ML modeling for accurate and efficient prediction of experimentally measured fundamental properties of CPs. Our study paves the way for the accelerated design and development of high-performance CPs in photoelectronic applications.",

                "abstract": "A fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics is that properties should be independent of representation. In self-consistent field methods such as density functional theory, this manifests as a requirement that properties be invariant with respect to unitary transformations of the occupied molecular orbitals and (separately) the unoccupied molecular orbitals.  Various ad hoc measures of excited-state charge separation that are commonly used to analyze time-dependent density-functional calculations violate this requirement, as they are based on incoherent averages of excitation amplitudes rather than averages over coherent superposition states.  As a result, these metrics afford markedly different values in various common representations including canonical molecular orbitals, Boys-localized orbitals, and natural transition orbitals (NTOs).  Numerical values of these charge-transfer metrics can be unstable with respect to basis-set expansion and may afford nonsensical values in the presence of extremely diffuse basis functions.  In contrast, metrics based on well-defined expectation values are stable, representation-invariant, and physically interpretable.  Although the NTO representation improves the stability of these ad hoc charge-transfer diagnostics, it remains the case that an incoherent average can only be connected to an expectation value in the absence of superposition.  For the NTO representation to satisfy this condition, the particle and hole density matrices must each be dominated by a single eigenvector so that the transition density is well described a single pair of NTOs.  Counterexamples are readily found where this is not the case.   ",

                "abstract": "Iodine oxidation reactions play an important role in environmental, biological, and industrial contexts. The multiphase reaction between aqueous iodide and ozone is of particular interest due to its prevalence in the marine atmosphere and unique reactivity at the air-water interface. Here, we explore the concentration dependence of the I- + O3 reaction in levitated microdroplets under both acidic and basic conditions. To interpret the experimental kinetics, molecular simulations are used to benchmark a kinetic model, which enables insight into the reactivity of the interface, the nanometer-scale sub-surface region, and the bulk interior of the droplet. For all experiments, a kinetic description of gas- and liquid-phase diffusion is critical to interpreting the results. We find that the surface dominates the iodide oxidation kinetics under concentrated and acidic conditions, with the reactive uptake coefficient approaching an upper limit of 10-2 at pH 3. In contrast, reactions in the sub-surface dominate under more dilute and alkaline conditions, with inhibition of the surface reaction at pH 12 and an uptake coefficient that is 10x smaller. The origin of a changing surface mechanism with pH is explored and compared to previous ozone-dependent measurements. ",

                "abstract": "The lanthanide elements are crucial components in numerous technologies, yet their industrial production through liquid-liquid extraction continues to be economically and environmentally costly due to the challenge of separating elements with similar physico-chemical properties. While computational ligand screening has shown promise towards discovering efficient extractants, the complexity of constructing chemically-sensible 3D structures (often by-hand), coupled with the high cost of quantum chemistry calculations, often limits exploration of the vast ligand chemical and conformational space in favor of local exploration around known chemistries. Moreover, metal complexes can have many stable configurations whose differences in energies exceed the small energy differences that determine extractant selectivity for certain lanthanides. Because of this difference, incorrect selectivity predictions can be made if the lowest energy coordination complex is not identified and modeled. To address this issue, we present a high- throughput computational workflow that automates the construction and quantum mechanical modeling of 3D lanthanide-extractant complexes. This approach allows for an unbiased search of distinct configurational and compositional variations for each metal, enabling accurate predictions of their solution structures and lanthanide selectivity. As showcased by three extractants from diverse chemical categories\u2014a crown ether, a phenanthroline monocarboxamide, and a malonamide\u2014it is found that sampling the lanthanide-ligand configuration space is critical to correctly predicting the solvation structure and experimental lanthanide selectivity trends.",

Understanding the\nrole of their hallucinatory effects is crucial for shaping\nthe future trajectory of antidepressant drug development.\nPhotoswitchable compounds targeting the 5-HT2AR offer\nprecise spatio-temporal control over the activation of\ndifferent downstream pathways. In this work, we\ncomputationally discovered PQ-azo-N,N-DMT (34), a\nphotoswitch with improved features compared to the\npreviously synthesized azo-N,N-DMT (1). The new\ncompound shows tight binding to the 5-HT2AR, retaining all\nimportant interactions of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD),\nexhibits positive membrane permeability, and has a strong\nred-shifted absorption that would allow photocontrol in the\nvisible spectrum.",

While\nsuch intracellular crowding can have a large impact on biomolecular structure and\nfunction, the molecular mechanisms and driving forces that determine the effect of\ncrowding on dynamics and conformations of macromolecules are so far not well un\u0002derstood. At a molecular level, computational methods can provide a unique lens to\ninvestigate the effect of macromolecular crowding on biomolecular behavior, providing\nus with a resolution that is challenging to reach with experimental techniques alone.\nIn this review, we focus on the various physics-based and data-driven computational\nmethods developed in the last few years to investigate macromolecular crowding and intracellular protein condensation. We review recent progress in modeling and simu\u0002lation of biomolecular systems of varying sizes, ranging from single protein molecules\nto the entire cellular cytoplasm. We further discuss the effects of macromolecular\ncrowding on different phenomena, such as diffusion, protein-ligand binding, and their\nmechanical and viscoelastic properties, such as surface tension of condensates. Finally,\nwe discuss some of the outstanding challenges that we anticipate the community ad\u0002dressing in the next few years in order to investigate biological phenomena in model\ncellular environments by reproducing in-vivo conditions as accurately as possible.",

                "abstract": "Ever since Aviram and Ratner theoretically proposed that rectifiers could be constructed from single molecules, great interest has been expressed in the development of single-molecular junctions as nano-electronic devices. In addition to their applications for molecular switches, chemical sensors, spin filters, and voltage-driven catalysis, such junctions are excellent prototypes for understanding charge transport at the single-molecule level. As the interface-to-bulk ratio becomes large at the nanoscale, the molecule-electrode interface dictates the properties of single-molecule junctions. To understand the various interfacial effects of the anchor group, bridging molecule, electrode material, and electrode binding site on the conductance, we present a simple and efficient tunneling model for coherent transport that is fully parameterized using density functional theory. Using this model, we calculate several properties, such as the binding energies, binding force constants, conductance, and current-voltage characteristics of junctions containing a benzene-1,4-dithiol or benzene-1,4-diamine molecule bridged between gold, silver, or copper electrodes. Due to the implementation of an effective mass in the tunneling model and the use of a range-separated, hydrid density functional, our predicted properties agree well with results from several independent experimental studies. We found that the conductance of benzene-1,4-dithiol depends sensitively on the binding site at the electrode whereas benzene-1,4-diamine shows no such dependence. Silver electrodes produce a much weaker quantum conductance current than gold electrodes due to a lower work function, whereas junctions with copper electrodes produce conductance and current quite similar to those with silver electrodes.",

                "abstract": "Combining a mean-field swelling model\u2014which incorporates the Poisson-Boltzmann cell model for describing the electrostatics of microgels and a Flory-Rehner-based model for describing the polymer network\u2014with the law of mass action to account for chemical reactions, we present a comprehensive swelling model for weakly charged microgels. This model provides an expression for the microgel osmotic pressure, used to determine the equilibrium swelling and, consequently, the net charge of the microgel as a function of reservoir pH, salt concentration, degree of polymerization, and other suspension and microscopic network properties. The model allows us to relate microscopic microgel features with the equilibrium swelling properties. The weak-field limiting case of the Poisson-Boltzmann theory is analyzed, yielding closed formulas. We validate the model against state-of-the-art coarse-grained simulations of a microgel, utilizing molecular dynamics to explore configurational degrees of freedom and the Monte Carlo grand-reaction method to simulate chemical reactions in equilibrium with a pH and salt reservoir. We test the model predictions for equilibrium ionization, size, and net charge against particle-based simulations and experiment. Our findings show that the model accurately describes microgel swelling and net charge over a wide range of pH levels. Although the accuracy decreases for larger salt concentrations, its overall qualitative accuracy makes it a reliable tool for parameter exploration and data interpretation, aiding in the rational design of microgel suspensions.",

                "abstract": "Designing innovative molecular structures tailored to specific protein targets represents a fundamental challenge in drug discovery. Most existing approaches based on graph neural networks for generating three-dimensional (3D) molecules within protein pockets often produce molecules with invalid configurations, suboptimal drug-like qualities and limited synthesizability, while also requiring extended generation times. To address these challenges, we present 3DSMILES-GPT, a fully language-model-driven framework for 3D molecular generation. Initially, leveraging the architecture of large language models, we treat both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D molecular representations as linguistic expressions and pre-train the model on an extensive dataset. This approach enables the model to comprehensively understand the 2D and 3D characteristics of large-scale molecules. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model on protein pocket and molecule pair data, followed by reinforcement learning to further optimize the biophysical and chemical properties of the generated molecules. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, 3DSMILES-GPT generates molecules with superior metrics, such as Vina docking score. Notably, it achieves a 33% enhancement in the quantitative estimation of drug-likeness (QED) compared to current models. Additionally, the generation speed is significantly improved, with a threefold increase over the fastest existing methods. This innovative approach highlights the potential of 3DSMILES-GPT to revolutionize the generation of drug-like molecules, offering both improved efficacy and efficiency in drug discovery process.",

                "abstract": "Advanced computational chemistry software packages have transformed chemical research by leveraging quantum chemistry and molecular simulations. Despite their capabilities, the complicated design and requirement for specialized computing hardware hinder their applications in the broad chemistry community. Here, we introduce AutoSolvateWeb, a chatbot-assisted computational platform that addresses both challenges simultaneously. This platform employs a user-friendly chatbot interface to guide non-experts through a multistep procedure involving various computational packages, enabling them to configure and execute complex quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of explicitly solvated molecules. Moreover, this platform operates on cloud infrastructure, allowing researchers to run simulations without prerequisite computing hardware. As a proof of concept, AutoSolvateWeb demonstrates that combining virtual agents with cloud computing can democratize access to sophisticated computational research tools.",

                "abstract": "Insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) is a zinc-dependent metalloenzyme involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity identified as a novel target for combating diabetes-induced diseases. IRAP\u2019s catalytic domain catalyzes the N-terminal peptide bond hydrolysis of the natural substrate oxytocin, a neuroactive pep-tide linked to improved cognition and other elemental brain functions. Angiotensin IV and similar peptides are recognized as cognitive enhancers due to their ability to competitively inhibit proteolytic activity of IRAP, reducing the degradation of natural neuropeptides. Despite a very similar binding complex between the substrate and the inhibitor with IRAP, especially around the scissile bond, it is unclear why the enzyme metabolizes oxytocin but does not efficiently degrade angiotensin IV. We employed enhanced sampling QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations to explore free energy landscapes for reaction of these two peptides in IRAP. A significantly higher energy barrier for the formation of the oxyanion tetrahedral intermediate (TI) and higher overall barrier for the peptide cleavage was observed for the reaction of angiotensin IV. Electronic structure analysis (NBO and NCI) revealed the reasons for different reactivity, including stabilization of the on the sigma hole of the N-terminus disulfide in oxytocin by the hybridizing lone pair of the scissile peptide nitrogen. The interplay between weak non-covalent spodium bond and strong bi-dentate coordination of the catalytic Zn2+ by angiotensin IV caused larger deviation of valine C-C\u03b1-C\u03b2 angle from the ideal tetrahedral, which destabilizes the TI. The results emphasise the importance of analysing dynamics, interactions and electronic properties of reaction intermediates and transition states in enzymes, and have implications for the de-sign and development of IRAP inhibitors for the treatment of memory disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes.

                "abstract": "Machine-learned Potentials (MLPs) have transformed the field of molecular simulations by scaling `quantum-accurate' potentials to linear time complexity. Yet, while they provide a more accurate reproduction of structural properties as compared to empirical force fields, it is still computationally costly to generate their training dataset from \\textit{ab initio} calculations. However, in the current literature, one MLP model is always specifically developed and employed for a specific system, and it is unexplored if one `general' MLP can be developed for a wide variety of structures. Herein, by leveraging upon data-efficient equivariant MLPs, we demonstrate the possibility of developing a general MLP for nearly 3,000 Zn-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). After generating a training dataset comprising augmented structures generated from DFT-optimized ones, we validated the trained MLP's reliability in predicting accurate forces and energies when evaluated on the test set that comprises chemically distinct MOF structures. Despite incurring slightly higher errors on structures containing rare chemical moieties, the general MLP can still reliably reproduce thermal and bulk properties for a large sample of Zn-based MOFs. Crucially, by developing one MLP for many structures, the computational cost of developing MLP(s) for high-throughput screening is potentially reduced by a few orders of magnitude. This enables us to predict `quantum-accurate' properties for notable Zn-MOFs that were previously un-investigated via expensive theoretical calculations. More broadly, our contribution facilitates the development of general MLPs to accelerate chemical discoveries among other systems of interest at a fraction of the computational cost. ",

                "abstract": "This work utilizes collected and organized instructional data from the field of chemical science to fine-tune mainstream open-source large language models. To objectively evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models, we have developed an automated scoring system specifically for the chemistry domain, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation results. Building on this foundation, we have designed an innovative chemical intelligent assistant system. This system employs the fine-tuned Mistral Nemo model as one of its primary models and features a mechanism for flexibly invoking various advanced models. This design fully considers the rapid iteration characteristics of large language models, ensuring that the system can continuously leverage the latest and most powerful AI capabilities.A major highlight of this system is its deep integration of professional knowledge and requirements from the chemistry field. By incorporating specialized functions such as molecular visualization, SMILES string processing, and chemical literature retrieval, the system significantly enhances its practical value in chemical research and applications. More notably, the system possesses autonomous evolution capabilities. Through carefully designed mechanisms for knowledge accumulation, skill acquisition, performance evaluation, and group collaboration, the system can continuously optimize its professional abilities and interaction quality. This dynamic adaptive feature enables the system to evolve autonomously, breaking through the inherent static limitations of traditional AI systems.",
