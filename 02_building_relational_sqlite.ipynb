    "## Introduction to SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases are often implemented in some flavor of SQL (Structured Query Language).\n",
    "Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language used to manage and manipulate relational databases.\n",
    "Some common SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.\n",
    "Each of these has their own SQL dialect, though they share many common features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will be learning about SQL command using SQLite. \n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is a lightweight, self-contained SQL database engine that is widely used for local databases in applications. \n",
    "It doesn't require a separate server to run, which makes it ideal for use in smaller applications or prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll create a database using SQLite, define our tables, and insert some initial data. \n",
    "Python has [built-in support as part of the Python Standard Library to interact with SQLite databases](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html), \n",
    "so we'll use the `sqlite3` module to interact with our database. \n",
    "At the end of this lesson, we'll also show how you could have performed the same tasks using the SQLite command line interface.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Using SQLite from Python\n",
    "\n",
    "To use SQLite from Python, we need to import the `sqlite3` module.\n",
    "We then, create a database connection by giving a file path to the database file we would like to use.\n",
    "As stated earlier, SQLite is a serverless database, so the database file is the database itself.\n",
    "In the next cell, we create a sqlite database called `research_articles.db`."

    "Currently, we have a database, but the database has no tables or structure.\n",
    "In order to add data to our database, we first need to define the database structure by defining our databases tables.\n",
    "As a reminder, we decided to have three tables: `authors`, `articles`, and `author_article`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define these, we will have to write SQL commands.\n",
    "SQL is what is called a \"declarative language\". \n",
    "This means when you use SQL, you are telling the computer *what* to do, but not necessarily *how* it is done. \n",
    "You will not control the program flow with loops and conditionals like in Python or C++, rather you issue commands like `SELECT` or `CREATE`.\n",
    "A SQL command is generally composed of several key parts: keywords, identifiers, operators, and the data itself. \n",
    "Keywords are specific terms like `SELECT`, `CREATE`, `INSERT`, and `DELETE`, each referring to a possible action in the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to create a table, you would use the `CREATE TABLE` keyword followed by your chosen table name and details about the columns it should contain.\n",
    "You use the `CREATE TABLE` keyword followed by the table name and a list of columns with their names and types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "    column1_name column1_type conditions,\n",

    "    ...\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to create our `DOI` column in our article table, the syntax would be something like\n",

    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Article (\n",
    "    DOI TEXT PRIMARY KEY\n",

    "We first define the SQL command as a multiline string in Python.\n",
